# Using Scikit-Learn Pipelines with Amazon SageMaker

In this notebook, we will have a look at which features from Amazon SageMaker can help you bring your ML workloads based on Scikit-Learn, and in particular Scikit-Learn Pipelines, to the AWS cloud in order to create scheduled pipelines of preprocessing and training, as well as having endpoints for generating predictions in real-time.
We will do this in three different modes, involving different features and complexity levels:

Level 1: SKLearn Pipeline in the Training script
Level 2 : Preprocessing with Processing, Training, Transformation & Inference in one Script
Level 3 : SageMaker Inference Pipelines
